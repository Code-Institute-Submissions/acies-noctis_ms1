#Acies Noctis

This website represents virtual home for my friend and artist Acies Noctis. Since Acies so far didn't have any official website I decided to create one with his help and feedback.
Since Acies Noctis is musican I wanted website to be focused on music first, and help him geting it out there. i belive the artis deserves strog and simple online presence and my aim with this website is to create it.

##UX
In my UX design I was following 5 plains of UXD.
1. Strategy plane
    * I talked to artist about ideas and we reached agreement on approach to develop this web page. 
    We decided to create website for musician which would provide stronger online presence and show his dedication towards art. 
2. Scope plane
    * I wanted to provide solid base website which is easy to upgrade and update.
    I wrote few different user stories to guide me in development.
        ###User stories
