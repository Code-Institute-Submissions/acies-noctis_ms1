# Acies Noctis

This website represents virtual home for my friend and artist Acies Noctis. Since Acies so far didn't have any official website I decided to create one with his help and feedback.
Acies Noctis is musican I wanted website to be focused on music first, and help him geting it out there. i belive the artis deserves strog and simple online presence and my aim with this website is to create it.

## UX
In my UX design I was following 5 plains of UXD.
1. Strategy plane
    * I talked to artist about ideas and we reached agreement on approach to develop this web page. 
    We decided to create website for musician which would provide stronger online presence and show his dedication towards art. 
2. Scope plane
    * I wanted to provide solid base website which is easy to upgrade and update.
    I wrote few different user stories to guide me in development.

### User stories

* As a fan of electronic music I want to listen to newly released music.
* As a fan of electronic music I want to find out where I can see artist perform live.
* As a fan of electronic music I want to buy/download music and support the artist.
* As record label owner I want to contact artist for colaboration/publishing deals.
* As venue owner I want to contact artist for live performance.
* As fan of electronic music I want to visit artist's Soundcloud/Bancamp page to listen to more of his music.
* As a fan I want to visit artist's social media to see what is he like in private life.

3. Structure, Skeleton and Surface plane I developed in my mockup design.
            * I used Figma to create mockup (link to mockup)
